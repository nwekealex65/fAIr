# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Users
**Q : What is fAIr?**

A : fAIr is an open-source toolkit developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) that enables the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into humanitarian mapping workflows. It provides AI models and tools to automate mapping tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy.

<hr>

**Q : How can I use fAIr in my mapping projects?**

A : Building for now but to use fAIr, you can follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation. Once installed, you can utilize the pre-trained AI models for tasks such as road network extraction, building footprint detection, or land use classification. The documentation offers examples and guidelines to help you get started.

<hr>

**Q : What types of data can I use with fAIr?**

A : fAIr primarily works with satellite imagery and aerial photographs. You can use various types of imagery sources which compiles with opensource imagery license to perform mapping tasks using the AI models provided. The documentation provides information on the compatible data formats and recommended data sources.

<hr>

**Q : Can I customize the AI models in fAIr for my specific needs?**

A : Yes, fAIr is designed to be customizable. The toolkit provides instructions and guidelines on how to train and fine-tune models with your own datasets. This allows you to adapt the models to suit your specific mapping requirements and improve their performance on your target areas or features of interest.

<hr>

**Q : Are there any limitations to using fAIr?**

A : While fAIr offers powerful AI models, it's important to note that the accuracy of the results may vary depending on the quality and resolution of the input imagery and the complexity of the mapping task. Some tasks may require additional manual editing or validation. It's recommended to review the documentation and understand the limitations of each model before use.

<hr>

**Q : How can I contribute feedback or report issues with fAIr?**

A : You can contribute to the improvement of fAIr by providing feedback, reporting issues, or suggesting new features through the project's GitHub repository. By creating an issue, you can share your observations or difficulties faced while using fAIr, allowing the developers to address them and enhance the toolkit.

<hr>

**Q : Can I integrate fAIr with other mapping tools or platforms?**

A : Yes, fAIr is designed to be modular and can be integrated into existing mapping workflows and platforms. It provides modular pip packages/ API endpoints that can be used in other scripts and can be integrated as plugins on different platforms such as Qgis, Josm etc. You can leverage the AI models from fAIr within these tools or use the outputs of fAIr in combination with other mapping datasets and tools.

<hr>

**Q : What programming languages and frameworks are used in fAIr?**

A : fAIr frontend is made with React and backend with Django.fAIr is primarily developed using Python, which is widely used in machine learning and AI. It leverages popular framework TensorFlow for model development and training. Familiarity with Python and these frameworks will be beneficial if you plan to work on fAIr's development.

<hr>

**Q : Are there any specific coding standards or guidelines for contributing to fAIr?**

A : Yes, fAIr follows coding standards and guidelines outlined in the project's repository. These guidelines cover aspects such as code formatting, documentation, and testing. Adhering to these standards helps maintain code consistency and facilitates collaboration among contributors.

<hr>

**Q : Can I propose new AI models or enhancements to existing models?**

A : Absolutely! The fAIr project welcomes contributions related to new AI models or enhancements to existing models. If you have developed a new model that aligns with the project's goals or if you have ideas to improve the current models, you can propose them through the GitHub repository at [fAIr-utilities](https://github.com/hotosm/fAIr-utilities) and engage in discussions with the community . Once approved community will be able go use it .

<hr>

**Q : What kind of support can I expect as a developer contributing to fAIr?**

A : As a developer contributing to fAIr, you can receive support and guidance from the project maintainers and the community. The maintainers can help address technical questions, review your contributions, and provide feedback. The community also offers a collaborative environment where you can interact with other contributors and share knowledge.

## Community Managers
**Q : Why can I only map buildings?**

A : fAIr currently only works with buildings. We are hoping in the future to expand to other feature types.

<hr>

**Q : Can we edit with JSON in fAir?**

A : Yes, that option is now available.

<hr>

**Q : If I map the same area  but in another editor, will fAIr take into account this data?**

A : Regardless of which editing tool you use, once it goes into OSM, it will be taken into fAIr as long as you click “fetch OSM” after they map

<hr>

**Q : If I map a little outside the task, selected AOI,  is the data also fed into fAIr? Or is it ignored?**

A : Anything that intersects with the AOI boundary is needed and will be counted in fAIr training data, buildings fully outside the boundary won’t be counted for training dataset but they are already in OSM

<hr>

**Q : I don’t remember what to do when I’m finished, just “fetch”?**

A : Yes, after mapping the selected AOI, you should come back to fAIr and fetch so you will see them  in fAIr.
